This is a tiny app built with Shoes (http://wiki.github.com/why/shoes) meant
to improve the development cycle for building other apps with shoes.

I found that as I was trying to learn Shoes, I often wanted to tinker with
things and see what they would look like, but the cycle of modifying the code,
saving it, and reopening it with Shoes was annoying.  This app lets you input
shoes code directly into a text box and with one click see what it rendered
by shoes.

I hope to add keyboard shortcuts as I better understand Shoes event handling
